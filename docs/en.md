# Official Ball Drop Guide

## Gameplay

The game is based on a simple yet engaging mechanic: every time you click (or tap on mobile), a ball drops from the sky. When two balls of the same type touch, they merge into a larger ball of the next level — from golf ball to medicine ball. Your score increases with each fusion.

As time passes and your score rises, the game becomes more challenging:
- Gravity increases  
- Ball bounce decreases  
- The danger zone at the top expands, reducing available space  

If a ball enters the red zone at the top, the game ends.

### Special Balls

The game includes special balls that add strategy and variety:
- **Bomb**: doesn’t merge, but explodes and destroys nearby balls  
- **Glass Ball**: gives triple points when merged, but breaks if it touches the ground  
- **Vortex Ball**: pulls nearby balls for 2 seconds after merging  
- **Detonator**: like the bomb, but if it collides with another detonator, it triggers all bombs  
- **Metal Ball**: rare ball, doesn’t merge and can only be destroyed by a bomb. After exploding, it releases a “Wildcard”  
- **Golden Ball**: similar to the metal ball but even rarer. After exploding, it releases either a “Wildcard” or “Fire”  

These balls appear randomly once a certain level is reached.

There are also two power-ups:

- **Wildcard**: transforms into any ball chosen by the player — it can become a regular or special ball (except the golden one)  
- **Fire**: destroys **all** balls currently on screen

### How to Play

1. Click or tap the screen to drop a ball  
2. Try to position it so it merges with a matching ball  
3. Keep merging to level up and increase your score  
4. Avoid letting balls reach the red zone at the top  

**Goal**: Achieve the highest score possible!
